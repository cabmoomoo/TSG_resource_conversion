# TSG_resource_conversion
 
STEAM DESCRIPTION

Make use of new buildings to convert base resources into more advanced ones, some of which can't be harvested naturally!

This mod add a current total of 4 new buildings, 3 new resources, and 9 new recipes, essentially enabling the conversion of one resource into another, typically at a profit!

This mod requires Recipe Redo! Many of the recipes in this mod require the change to the formula made there to function fully. Please make sure you enable both when creating a new game, or else things will be (even more) incredibly unbalanced!

This mod, content wise, is in a functional form, achieving all the goals I originally set out to. There's most likely room to expand, especially with the farming concept, but as is, this is a mod that adds enough to the game I'm comfortable with releasing it now. The biggest issue is the graphics, or lack thereof. All of the resources have new, custom made sprites, but the buildings are still a work in progress. I hope to complete their design myself over time, but I'm no artist, so that could take quite some time. If there are any artistic volunteers, let me know; I'd be more than happy to handle the code part of the mod, and let someone more competent handle the making it look good part. In the meantime, feel free to also comment on the balance and functionality of the mod - any feedback is welcome!

For the modders out there, feel free to take a gander at the code of this mod as always. Seeing as this is an actual content mod, I went through the trouble of making entirely new research and building categories, so mod compatibility is actually quite high, given that no one makes use of the sane ID's as me.
